            <div class="stars-text">
                The life cycle of a star spans billions of years. As a general rule, 
                the more massive the star, the shorter its life span.
                Birth takes place inside hydrogen-based dust clouds called nebulae.
                Over the course of thousands of years, gravity causes pockets of dense
                matter inside the nebula to collapse under their own weight. One of 
                these contracting masses of gas, known as a protostar, represents a 
                star’s nascent phase. Because the dust in the nebulae obscures them, 
                protostars can be difficult for astronomers to detect.
                As a protostar gets smaller, it spins faster because of the conservation 
                of angular momentum—the same principle that causes a spinning ice skater 
                to accelerate when she pulls in her arms. Increasing pressure creates 
                rising temperatures, and during this time, a star enters what is known as 
                the relatively brief T Tauri phase.Millions of years later, when the core 
                temperature climbs to about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees 
                Celsius), nuclear fusion begins, igniting the core and setting off the next—and 
                longest—stage of a star’s life, known as its main sequence.
                Most of the stars in our galaxy, including the sun, are categorized as main 
                sequence stars. They exist in a stable state of nuclear fusion, converting 
                hydrogen to helium and radiating x-rays. This process emits an enormous amount 
                of energy, keeping the star hot and shining brightly.
